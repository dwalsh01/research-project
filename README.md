# Research Project for 3rd Year Computer Science Module

## Aims

1. Improve upon the current system in place.
2. Increase our understanding of software engineering practices and procedures.
3. Learn about new frameworks and improve our understanding of technology we are familiar with.

## Installation guide

1. You must first clone the repository locally:

   ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/dwalsh01/research-project.git
   ```

2. You must then activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the requirements:

   ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Now we move on to installing the ReactJS frontend:

   - install dependencies with npm:

   ```bash
       cd research-react && npm install
   ```

5. Now you should be able to run the project using either:
   - python directly
   ```bash
       python3 app.py
   ```
   - flask, by declaring FLASK_APP=app.py and then running:
   ```bash
       flask run
   ```
